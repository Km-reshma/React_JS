# React_JS
Self Learning and self-notes for React

React:
1. React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer 'Jordan Walke'.
2. React is an open source front-end javascript library which is used for building UI(user interfaces) and      component based architecture.
3. React is used to build single page application.
4. React allows us to create reusable UI components.


5. React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
6. React only changes what needs to be changed
React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

We create react app but this is not optimal like:
ReactDom.render(
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    document.getElementById('root')
);

Instead of we create app in two ways:

Method 1: Using create-react-app (Deprecated)

Step 1 : Navigate to your folder, where you want to create a project and open it in terminal.
Step 2 : In the terminal of that application directory type : 
        "npx create-react-app <<Application_Name>>"
Step 3 : Navigate to the newly created folder using the command  
        "cd <<Application_Name>>"
Step 4: A default application will be created with the following project structure and dependencies 
It will install some packages by default which can be seen in the dependencies in package.json file as follows:

"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}

Step 5: To run this application type the following command in terminal
        "npm start"
